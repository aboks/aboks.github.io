title: "Serving compressed SVG files"
excerpt: >
  Over the years, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become the de facto standard for vector images on the web. 
  One of its disadvantages however is its verbose XML-based format, with relatively large file sizes as a result. 
  Luckily, the plaintext nature of XML lends itself well to compression. Serving compressed SVG files correctly 
  from a web server takes some care however.
