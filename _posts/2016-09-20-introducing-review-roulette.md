title: "Introducing Review Roulette"
excerpt: >
  At Moxio we recently started an experiment we called 'Review Roulette': a process of randomized code reviews. 
  We believe this emphasizes code reviews as a means of bidirectional learning and helps onboarding junior developers, 
  and thus improves upon our previous review 'policy'. In this post I would like to sketch the background behind this 
  experiment, explain the idea of Review Roulette and present some preliminary results.
