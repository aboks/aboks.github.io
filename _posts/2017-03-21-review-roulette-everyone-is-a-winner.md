title: "Review Roulette: Everyone is a winner!"
excerpt: >
  In an earlier blog post I introduced our idea of Review Roulette, a process of randomized code reviews with 
  the aim to foster learning and increase collective code ownership. I explained that we would try this idea 
  out as an experiment for two months and evaluate afterwards. I also promised to share the results of that 
  evaluation. In this post I will do so, and describe the steps we took to make Review Roulette work even 
  better for us.
