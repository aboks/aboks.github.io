title: "On type safety without generics, and the role of package design"
excerpt: >
  At Moxio we strongly value writing type-safe code. This can be a challenge in PHP however, especially as 
  it lacks a feature known as ‘generics’. In this blog post I will show how (lack of) generics influences 
  type-safe design, how parameter types and return types may change when extending a class or interface, 
  and how we can keep our package design sound while doing so.
