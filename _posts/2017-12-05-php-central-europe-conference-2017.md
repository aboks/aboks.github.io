title: "PHP Central Europe conference 2017"
excerpt: >
  Early November I attended the first edition of phpCE, a new PHP community conference in Central Europe, 
  originating from a merger between PHPCon Poland and Brno PHP conference. In this blog post I would like to 
  share some of my experiences and things I have learned during that event.
