title:  "Workshop: Metrics-driven refactoring and quality"
---

You may have seen a talk on code metrics, or know how cyclomatic complexity is calculated. You may have 
a tool in your CI pipeline that calculates metrics on your code, only to never look at them. Metrics sound 
useful in theory, but how can we actually make use of them in our day-to-day work?

In this workshop we will discover in practice how metrics can guide us when refactoring a codebase. We will 
see how metrics can show us which parts of the code to focus our attention on and what kind of refactoring 
to apply to them. Weâ€™ll let metrics drive our improvements - not for the sake of the numbers, but to actually 
improve the maintainability and quality of our code.
