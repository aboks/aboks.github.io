title:  "PageRank all the things!"
---

Most people know PageRank as Google’s algorithm for ranking search results, but it’s uses extend far beyond
only that: PageRank has already been utilised for analysing social networks, finding the most important functions
in source code, predicting traffic, and deriving a more accurate ranking table of teams in an ongoing sports
competition.

In this session we will cover the basics of linear algebra, developing an intuitive notion of how matrices
and vectors interact, and use it to understand the principles of PageRank. Then we’ll jump straight into
real-life applications of PageRank beyond web search and how these can be implemented in PHP using the math-php
library.
