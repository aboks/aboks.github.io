title:  "Getting started with PHP core development"
---

While PHPâ€™s open source community is thriving, only a relatively small number of PHP developers contribute to the 
number one tool they use on a daily basis: PHP itself. Although it may seem daunting to help out on a project written 
in C, requiring compilation and linking, getting started is actually pretty easy. 

In this talk I would like to share my own recent experiences of beginning to contribute to PHP itself. We will see 
different ways to contribute and cover some practical tips, workflows and resources, so you can start giving back 
to your programming language straight away!
