title:  "The Web of the Future: Introduction to the Semantic Web"
---

What if we could evolve our web of individual documents and data to a web of interlinked knowledge, a web where
machines can automatically combine data from multiple sources and draw conclusions from it? The Semantic Web
technologies from W3C enable us to make sense of the data wilderness on the web and unlock the full potential
of the data treasures hidden in it.

In this talk, we will see how RDF enables us to formally describe the meaning of data and how such data can be
queried with SPARQL. We will look at how OWL lets us make more expressive statements about the world, so that a
computer can logically reason about it and infer new information. We will demonstrate these technologies by showing
how they can be used to query seemingly incompatible data sets as if they were one and letting a computer draw
logical (and perhaps surprising) conclusions for us.

Contains: ‘retro’ technology, linked data, fundamental properties of the web, and Donald Trump’s opinion on PHP
frameworks.
