title:  "Finding your way with Wardley maps"
---

Imagine you are out in the woods and don’t know which way to go. What you need is not a SWOT analysis, 
you need a map! The same hold for strategic decisions for a company or product. By creating maps we can 
obtain situational awareness, come up with strategic decisions that make sense, evaluate their effect as 
movement on the map, and adapt. 

In this session I will introduce you to the practice of Wardley mapping, a technique to make strategic 
decisions based on the competitive landscape surrounding a company or product. We will learn how to 
create maps and predict future movement using climatic patterns. We will see how characteristics of 
components differ across stages of evolution, and how this should influence decisions like buy vs. build. 
And of course we will look at strategical patterns we can deploy based on our new situational awareness. 

Whether you’re working in an autonomous team, are involved with company or product strategy, or have the 
ambition to be: this session is for you!
