I am a software developer/architect from The Netherlands, mainly working with PHP and Javascript. I work at 
[Moxio](https://www.moxio.com), where we build web-based software for information management with an awesome team. 
Having studied mathematics at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), my interests lie on the boundary of mathematics
and software engineering, where formal modelling and logical reasoning meet practical problems and pragmatism. To
share my knowledge and ideas, I like to [speak](speaking.md) at conferences and meetups and write [blog posts](blog.md)
about my development adventures. When possible, I release some of my work as [open source](https://github.com/aboks) or
contribute to projects created by others.
